# Respiratory Documents

This repository contains documents I've needed for respiratory medicine practice. There are national and international guidelines on areas such as non invasive ventilation but many institutions will need their own local policy or guideline, leading to duplicated effort. Feel free to clone and adapt to your local circumstances.

I use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to build pdfs from the markdown with a template that adds my institution's headers, etc.
